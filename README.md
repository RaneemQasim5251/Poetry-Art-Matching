# Paint Poem Matcher

> **An AI-Powered Art & Poetry Synthesis Engine**

A sophisticated machine learning application that bridges the gap between visual art and literary expression by intelligently matching paintings with poems based on emotional resonance and thematic alignment.

## 🎯 Overview

This project leverages advanced natural language processing and computer vision techniques to create meaningful connections between classical paintings and poetry. The system analyzes emotional undertones, color palettes, compositional elements, and thematic content to generate perfect art-poetry pairings.

## ⚡ Technical Architecture

### Backend Engine
- **Flask** - RESTful API architecture
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** - Deep learning models for image analysis
- **NLTK/spaCy** - Natural language processing for poetry analysis
- **Pandas/NumPy** - Data manipulation and statistical analysis

### Frontend Interface
- **React** - Modern, responsive user interface
- **Material-UI** - Clean, professional design system
- **D3.js** - Interactive data visualizations
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated graphics rendering

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Computer Vision**: Extracts visual features, color analysis, composition understanding
- **NLP Engine**: Semantic analysis, emotional tone detection, thematic clustering
- **Matching Algorithm**: Multi-dimensional similarity scoring with weighted feature vectors
- **Neural Networks**: Custom-trained models for art-poetry correlation

## 🔧 Key Features
